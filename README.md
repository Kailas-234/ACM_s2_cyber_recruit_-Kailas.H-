Branch: ECE sem-2

I'am and ECE student and I chose to explore cybersecurity becuase it strongly compliments my core domain. Areas such as hardware security, embedded sytems, network security etc are closely related  to ECE concepts.These topics I've searched on google and i dont really have any prior knowlegde about these subjects but i sure would love to get to know more about them and i hope this club will provide me with the required support and knowledge.
